excerpt: 'In this study, we propose to forecast medium-term reservoir production without model calibration. We combine the data of multiple pre-existent models. A weight is then associated with each model regarding its relevance in forecasting production for the next time step. An optimization
algorithm that minimizes a function based on the error of the projection of oil and water production in relation to the real reservoir data is considered for the computation of the weights.'
