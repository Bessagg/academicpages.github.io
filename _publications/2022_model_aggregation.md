excerpt: 'In this study, we propose to
forecast medium-term reservoir production without model calibration. More precisely, we combine the data of multiple
pre-existent models which represent the previous uncertainty associated with the reservoirâ€™s parameters. A weight is then
associated with each model regarding its relevance in forecasting production for the next time step. An optimization
algorithm that minimizes a function based on the error of the projection of oil and water production in relation to the real
reservoir data is considered for the computation of the weights. This strategy is then validated through a case study for a
set of 50 realizations of the Olympus synthetic reservoir model. The findings indicate an average prediction error below
5% for different realizations taken as reference.'
