## Surgical Instruments Detection with Yolo (2024--)
 -	The objective was to automate inventory managment with computer vision. A task that took over 30minutes, was done in less than 10 seconds using our AI app and phone camera.
 -	The model identified missing components.
 -	Some components (screws) were identified by their positions in the box, different clustering algorithms were used to split components in regions, rows and columns, so the exact component's ID was identified.
 -	The components and the containers were made of aluminium, which is reflective and yields low contrast. So I tested different light conditions, camera position and opencv morphological transformations.

## Patient's Clinical Outcome Prediction (2023--)
- Objective: Accelerate treatment for high-risk patients by leveraging real-time data. Lab results often indicate risk before the next scheduled consultation. The model runs 24/7, providing instant alerts to doctors, speeding up intervention.

## Model aggregation to forecast medium-term reservoir production (2020-2021)
 -	Scientific initiation project, with a published paper in on of the biggest energy congress of the world, Rio Oil and Gas.
 -	I worked in Fortaleza's research group, STORMS. We used realizations of a benchmark resevouir model "OLYMPUS" as models to forecast production.
 -	We associated weights to each model and tested different optimization alogirthms to minimize a developed loss function.
 -	This strategy was validated with an average prediction error below 5%;


## Car suspension design - Apuama Racing - FSAE (2018-2019)
-	Used mathematical models to create vehicle simulations (point-mass-model, biclycle-model).
-	Developed a Suspension distribution forces program in Matlab. We would use the maximum forces obtained in braking and cornering simulations to dimension and reduce mass of the suspension kunckle.
-	Project to reduce steering torque for better handling of the vehicle.
-	Method to measure the car's center of gravity and validate simulations.
